					<p>
					Hello, my name is ZulaBrokenWing and welcome to my site!
					</p>

					<p>
					I'm an artist interested in animation and illustration. I 
					also dabble in story telling. My strong suit is character 
					art, especially creature artwork. I plan to expand my 
					art further to specialize in animation, 3D models, and 
					environments.
					</p>

					<p>
					On this site you will find a gallery of my artwork, 
					information on my commissions, and a brief summary 
					of my stories involved with my artwork.
					</p>
