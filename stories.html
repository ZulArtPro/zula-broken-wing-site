					<!-- Article text -->
					<p>
					    I've made many stories throughout my time as an artist. Exploring ideas through my artistic medium of drawing.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        Below are just a few summaries of stories I've made throughout the years:

                    <!-- Beblune Article Text -->
                    <p>
                        Beblunes are a semi-closed ARPG (Art Roleplaying Game) species. 
                        I have created several stories from this fun interactive world with friends of mine. 
                        All of my Beblunes have a variety of stories they go through and all have their own unique personalities to them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These stories range from Roarkion who was once part of this cult known as Endershutt, 
                        later falling in love with one of Endershutt's captors who he was tasked with guarding. 
                        Leading to the two escaping from Endershutt and betraying his best friend at the time, Taozuli. 
                        He now has two kids and a loving wife as they go on adventures together. 
                        With the lingering threat that Endershutt still seeks revenge, with Taozuli constantly hot on their trail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then there's Nazralvia who is simply a damsel in distress, 
                        who travels with her cart of goods in hopes to make a profit to keep going in life. 
                        Often surrendering to getting robbed in the process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's also Cedric and Pumpkin, two deep sea divers always on the lookout for treasure at the bottom of the sea. 
                        Whatever they find, it will come at a hefty price for their efforts. Otherwise, back to the sea it goes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course, I can't leave out the most ambitious project I've been working on in Beblunes. The Zarisia x Xircon family. 
                        These two love birds so far have had 11 pups together storywise, all of which are the main characters in their own adventures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Such as their first hatched Daonoza, a rebellious young adult who got caught up in the wrong crowd growing up. 
                        Who now often steals from towns with a Beblune around his age named Juelacko. 
                        Along with being a high profile thief, he also is a breaker of hearts as well. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Their second child Morganite also has her own story, involving her joining an army to be with her lover who is a general named Kichiro.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Psyche meanwhile is the embodiment of perfectionist narcissist. 
                        She believes she is the greatest gift Taurnar (the Beblune's planet) has ever received from Tecticore (the Beblune gods). 
                        She demands the finer things in life, and is enabled by her parents due to their immense amount of wealth and fortune. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These are just a few of the stories my Beblunes have, plus just only of my own Beblunes mentioned. 
                        Many of my Beblune's stories intermingle with many others who are owned by different friends of mine. 
                        It's a super fun world to be a part of and the art events always add something new and exciting to my Beblune's stories.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Omnis Mythos translated from Latin into English means All Myths. 
                        This is a world I'm experimenting with, where all myths and mythological creatures are real and thrive together. 
                        Where in this reality all myths are real in their reality, and it's the humans that are the ones considered myth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This world I use to place any mythological creatures and cryptids into, when they don't fit any other of my stories. 
                        This is a fun world building project of mine, and is still in very rough development. 
                        Only currently containing one concrete character named Tryton, who is a kelpie. You will find him a few times within my gallery.

                    <!-- Omnis Mythos Article Text -->
                    <p>
                        Currently this project has no formal name to it. 
                        This project began as I thought up the concept of speculative evolution of aliens on other planets. 
                        The main focus being on the Zhevok, an alien race who reflects the dark side of humanity based on how we treat each other on a galactic scale. 
                        Along with many other weird and wonderful alien creations of mine.
