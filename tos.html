                        <strong>Below is a general description on what I will and won't draw.</strong>
                        Anything not covered in either list or *starred* is subject to discussion on a case by case basis. 
                        Please keep my art style in mind while commissioning me, which can be viewed in my gallery and commission examples. 
                        As stated in the will NOT section, I won't copy or attempt to mimic another artist's or a company's art style.

                    <p>
                        I currently only accept <strong>USD as payment</strong> through <strong>PayPal</strong> (subject to gaining more outlets of payment in future).
                        <br/><br/>
                        The commission will not start until payment is received.
                        <br/>
                        It is the commissioner's responsibility to inform payment has been sent before the commission process begins.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Willing to offer payment plans for more expensive commissions. Must be discussed with me <strong>before</strong> commission(s) have been ordered.
                        <br/><br/>
                        <strong>NO REFUNDS</strong> once the physical commission process has started/has been completed.
                        <br/>
                        Refunds will only be accepted if the physical commission process hasn't started, which will issue a full refund.
                        <br/>
                        Refunds may also be given if the commission is dropped for whatever reason.
                        <br/>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Discussion of the commission</strong> can be made through any outlet mentioned in my contact page.
                        <br/><br/>
                        <strong>ANY</strong> inappropriate conduct by the commissioner (begging for free art, insisting payment in exposure, 
                        harassment of the artist or others, 
                        breaking of the TOS agreement, and so on) will result in the artist swiftly blocking the commissioner and canceling the commission. 
                        (Any payment sent will <strong>NOT</strong> be refunded).
                        <br/><br/>
                        I, the artist, am not obligated to unblock any commissioner for any reason whatsoever. Once a block has been made, 
                        you are <strong>BANNED</strong> from both contacting and commissioning me.

                            before going into the next phase of the process. 
                            Here is where the most amount of changes can be requested by the commissioner, afterwards each step following becomes more and 
                            more restricted for changes.

                            Depending on the piece, this part of the process could be very different after the initial sketch. During this phase only a few 
                            changes can be made between the artist and the commissioner. Once this step is completed, only finishing touches/tweeks will 
                            be added by the artist.

                            Any final touches will be discussed between the artist and the commissioner. Once this phase is completed, 
                            the artwork itself will be final and will not be changed.
